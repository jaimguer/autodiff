# Thoughts
## Operator overloading is DSL construction
At the highest level, we can understand operator overloading as a way to implement a DSL.  This is particularly useful in our case, where both implementations (more or less) retain their mathematical flavor.

## Derivative construction is metaprogramming

## Optimizations to derivative calculations
